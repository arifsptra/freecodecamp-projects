        <div class="tribute-info-article">
          <p>Saridin at the Kudus College not only irritated the students who felt they were seniors, but also troubled Sunan Kudus. As a new student in the field of religion, Miyono's people are smarter than the other students.</p>
          <p>Not to mention the ability in the science of kasepuhan. This made him have to face his own problems at the college. And that's what he showed when he argued with the teacher about water and fish.</p>
          <p>To test Saridin's clairvoyance, Sunan Kudus asked, "Is there fish in every water?" Saridin lightly replied, "Yes, Kanjeng Sunan."</p>
          <p>
            Hearing this answer, the teacher ordered a student to pick a coconut from a tree in the yard. The coconut is broken. It turned out that the truth of Saridin's answer was proven. In the coconut there are indeed a number of fish.
            That's why Sunan Kudus or Djafar Sodiq as a teacher smiled faintly. However, other students considered Saridin presumptuous and showing off his intelligence. Because it was another day, when he was on duty to fill the bath and
            place for ablution, the students made fun of him. The students use all the buckets to fetch water.
          </p>
          <p>Saridin is not feeling well. Because when the students who got their turn to fill the water tank, including him, were busy on duty, he was unemployed because he didn't get a bucket. He borrowed a bucket from a student.</p>
          <p>
            But what did the student say? "If you want to work, there is a basket." Basic Saridin. He took the basket to carry water. In an instant the tub and the ablution place were full of water. The other students are just dumbfounded
